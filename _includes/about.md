The Open GApps Project is an open-source effort to script the automatic generation of up-to-date {{site.ga}} packages.<br />On {{site.org}} you can find more information about the project effort and also pre-built {{site.ga}} packages generated by the {{site.org}} buildbot.

Some highlights about the characteristics of the Open GApps packages:

- All platforms and all Android versions are supported
- DPI-optimized support for **all** Google packages (unlike other GApps)
- Frequently updated {{site.ga}}: The pre-built {{site.org}} packages are updated every (European) night (if there are any updated {{site.ga}} available)
- Strong compression, allowing for relatively small downloads of even the most complete packages
- Automatic backup: It is not necessary to re-flash {{site.ga}} when you flash a ROM update. Most ROMs support this (addon.d) function
- The installer checks your device's capabilities, like the system partition size. It will notify you, before making any changes, if it finds any problems
- Several package variations, from a Google Super Package (includes all applications that ever shipped on a Google device), to a Stock package that equals the set of applications found on the most current and complete Nexus, to smaller, minimalist packages and an AROMA package that allows graphical selection of what to install
- A special 'for Stock ROM' installation mode that allows to update the {{site.ga}} on Stock ROMs that conform to the original Google Nexus filesystem structure
- All package installations can be customized to your individual preferences using our [exclusive Advanced Features and Options](https://github.com/opengapps/opengapps/wiki/Advanced-Features-and-Options)

Take note that Open GApps does not provide you with any license for Google's APKs included in the package.
The Open GApps packages merely provide a convenient way to sideload APKs to your device.
It is your own responsibility to obtain the proper permissions by e.g. buying an [OHA](https://www.openhandsetalliance.com)-licensed device with pre-installed Google Apps and/or acquiring the applications from [Google's Play Store](https://play.google.com/store).

The pre-built packages from {{site.org}} are provided ONLY as courtesy by {{site.org}} without warranty of ANY kind, under the terms that they can be freely used for personal use only, and are not allowed to be mirrored to the public other than {{site.org}}.
